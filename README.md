# Capstone Project - Enhanced E-commerce Platform

## Introduction

This capstone project is an enhanced e-commerce platform incorporating various features to provide a more engaging and user-friendly shopping experience. Leveraging Affinidi's identity verification capabilities, the platform ensures secure and personalized interactions.

## Affinidi Integration

### Identity Verification

Integrated Affinidi's identity verification processes to facilitate secure user interactions. This allows users to share specific attributes or credentials without revealing unnecessary personal information, enhancing trust and security.

## E-commerce Platform Features

### 1. Size Selection for Each Item

Implemented a size selection feature for each product. Users can choose the appropriate size before adding items to the cart, ensuring a personalized shopping experience, especially for products with size variations.

### 2. Wishlist Section

Introduced a wishlist section where users can add their favorite items for future reference. The wishlist displays product images, names, and an option to remove items. This feature enhances user engagement and allows them to curate a collection of desired products.

### 3. Modal for Cart and Wishlist Actions

Incorporated modal pop-ups for actions related to the cart and wishlist. Users receive instant feedback on successful additions or removals from the cart and wishlist. The modals provide a seamless and user-friendly interaction.

### 4. Dynamic Button States

Ensured dynamic button states for wishlist items. The "Add to Wishlist" button changes to "Remove from Wishlist" after a successful addition. This visual feedback improves the user experience and prevents accidental re-additions.

### 5. Separate Wishlist and Cart Modals

Created separate modal components for cart and wishlist actions. This division provides clarity and a distinct visual representation for different user interactions, reducing confusion.

### 6. Wishlist to Cart Transition

Implemented a smooth transition from the wishlist to the cart after selecting the "Add to Cart" option. Users are prompted to select a size through a dedicated modal, ensuring a seamless transition between these two essential features.
